## 📝 Project Takeaways
New things I learned from this project: 
1. Sprite sheets and bone-based animation.
2. Animating characters with states. 
3. Working with Unity tilemap, creating tile rules and palletes, and painting levels with it.
4. Working with Cinemachine, and the Cinemachine confiner extension (really cool stuff honestly). 
5. Creating physics layers and altering the collision matrix. 
6. Caching. 
7. Learning to add and use SFX better.
